# apm mutating admission webhook

This is the repo for apm mutating admission webhook for kubernetes. It contains
both the webhook receiver and a helmchart for managing the receiver's
lifecycle within kubernetes.

The software contained in this repo is considered a **technical preview**, and
is not yet recommended for use in a production cluster.

Learn more and get started in our [documentation](elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/apm-mutating-admission-webhook.html).

## webhook

The purpose of the webhook receiver is to modify pods so that they are
automatically instrumented by an elastic apm agent. Currently, the java,
nodejs, and dotnet agents are supported.

## helmchart

The helmchart manages configuring all the associated manifest files for the
webhook receiver, including generating certificates for securing communication
between the kubernetes api server and the webhook receiver.

  sudo install kubectl
```

## kind

  sudo install kind
```

## helm

## skaffold

skaffold:
```
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64 && \
  sudo install skaffold /usr/local/bin/
```

# dev workflow

## webhook

Do your normal go development in the top-level *.go files of this repo.

## helmchart

start the local kubernetes cluster using `kind`:

```
kind create cluster --config kind.yaml
```

a config is created at `~/.kube/config`, which is already set to communicate
with the cluster. if using two clusters, cf.:
https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#interacting-with-your-cluster

`skaffold` manages installing, updating, and removing the helmchart.

start the watcher in a separate terminal with `skaffold dev`. this watches for
changes the files within the helmchart, the Dockerfile, and any file
dependencies specified by the Dockerfile. A change will trigger an update
within the kubernetes cluster.

## debugging

docker exec into the running KinD node
From there, the pod network is exposed on the host, ie.

```
docker exec -it <kind container id> bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
# note the ip addr
curl 10.244.0.16:5678
```

## deploying the example container

to deploy a simple echo server:

```
./example_deploy.sh
```

it already has the correct annotation. you can check that it's been configured
correctly by the webhook using `kubectl`.

# removing KinD

get the available clusters:

```
kind get clusters
```

delete desired clusters

```
kind delete cluster <cluster-name>
```
